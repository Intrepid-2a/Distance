need to change:

- main_path and data_path only work on the PC in Glasgow: make relative paths

- use window object with system-specifications from the EyeTracker thing, also includes:
    - fusion stimuli
    - gamma grids (where available) 
    - colours for background and stimuli
    - ...

    - maybe we should have 1 fixation stimulus in the eye-tracker thing as well (currently, the size is specified in pixels, but I feel this should be degrees)

- read blind spot and colour calibration from the correct folder
- make all stimuli monocular
- make the blind spot marker smaller than the mapped blind spot, otherwise people will probably see the markerin a majority of trials and will probably no longer abort, even when that would be really necessary
- add some bookkeeping to be able to send proper comments into the eye-tracking signal to mark trial events
- handle all the different aborts and quits to mark such events in the eye-tracking data and to properly shut down in the case of quitting the task (which would be easier if there was only 1 spot to do this - see below)


easy to change:

- make the code into a function: ensure all data has the same participant ID, etc
- the first calibration has a text shown that people will do calibration, but the eye-tracker code already does that... I could remove it from the experiment, but there is a difference: in the experiment it waits for a key-press on the first calibration: that could be valuable
    this could be done by changing the text (e.g. "press space to do eye-tracker calibration" or some such) or by having a more complicated calibration function in the eye-tracker object that allows different texts and can wait for key-presses if you'd tell it to do so


not easy to change (and not really necessary):

- remove unnecessary variables from experiment and behavioral data files (reduces bookkeeping & errors in bookkeeping)


unsure whether it's necessary to change or not worth the trouble:

- in the code right now, there are several while loops within each trial, the function of which seems unclear:
    - there is a loop starting at line 237 that just waits half a second, this could simply be incorporated in the main trial loop
    - this loop has code to recalibrate if you're in it for more than 5 seconds, but it exits itself after 0.5 seconds, so that part could be removed
    - the main trial loop (starting at line 280) has a few oddities:
        - unimportant point: it shows stimuli based on 3 time intervals, whereas there are only 2: the period that pair 1 is on the screen, and the period where pair 2 is on the screen
        - this loop stops after 1.3 seconds, before a response can be given... during this loop no response other than quiting ('q' key) is allowed... I would start listening to the keyboard input during this loop (if time > 1.3 s)
          so there is separate code for the interval where people can give a response, but this seems unnecessarily complicated to me
    - the experiment exits in a few different spots, duplicating code and inviting human error in maintaining this code
      some of these might actually just break a loop and then end up from one into the other
        - line 257 (or does this just exit the trial... doesn't say)
        - line 310
        - line 316
        - line 334
        - line 337 and the following ones
        - line 359
        - line 368
        - line 381
        - line 391
        - line 400
        - and at the end of the experiment
      I'd split these into abort (trial, by choice) / abort (trial, no fixation or maybe when it takes too long) / quit (experiment)
      and structure the code so there is 1 place where both types of abort happen, and one place where the experiment quits
      (I can't immediately tell if this is now handled correctly or not, since it's not obvious from the structure of the code and it can be, perhaps should be)
